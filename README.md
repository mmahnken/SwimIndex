swimcreate
==========

a swim workout generator

Generates pseudo-random swimming sets for people who don't like to write their own workouts. 
It's like a swim coach in your pocket.

Built in Python using Postgresql (auto-generating a database of swim sets), SQLAlchemy, and Flask.

User input: Distance level (short, mid, or long distance), Interval base time (for 100 freestyle),
and type of set (butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle, drill, IM, pull, or kick).

Output: 1 swim set, such as "4 X 100 Breaststroke @ 2:10"
